## The Johnny-Five Open Source Organization

[Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) has been a leader in JavaScript robotics since the start of JavaScript robotics. It provides an abstraction layer over hardware and a common set of apis that has allowed programmers, hobbyists, and makers to learn one set of "tools" and apply them in many many places to do many many things. For years the entire community of thousands of users around hundreds of libraries have had a singlular focus on the Johnny-Five library that started it all. Since then we've had a fair number of very useful modules and projects pop up that are directly related to Johnny-Five but not actually the library itself. We have plugins, applications, and even entire code deployment systems that are very related but not the JavaScript library we all know and love. 

Johnny-Five is built on a philosophy that it should be easy to use. That it should do its best to help you be successful as a developer. To do its best to help you be *awesome* in your endevors into physical computing. All these projects share in this philosophy.

Out of our ecosystem of people, parts and software we're starting `j5js`. A github organization to house and foster the development of the core libraries of the Johnny-Five platform. When you see a library, tool, or application in the j5js organization you can expect to find a well maintained and supported library that meets a usablity standard around documntation, clean apis, and compatability that made Johnny-Five the success it is today.

On the surface nothing should change about your favorite projects. The URLs will redirect, the maintainers will be the same people with the same control of their projects. All we ask is that every project keep a set of agreed upon standards to help ensure our users sucecss.

# Standards
Every Project in the organization should:

 - Have at least one maintainer
 - Have up to date documentation (readme or wiki is plenty)
 - Adhere to the ([Johnny-Five Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
 - Have a [contributing guide](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
 - Have automated tests when applicable

These standards make projects easy to work with, contribute to, and learn from.

# J5JS Organization Memebership

If you've contributed code or documentation to any project in any `j5js` repo you are now a member of the organization. (This should be an automated processes.) The badge on your profile means you've helped improve any one of our projects and you should show it off proudly because you earned it.

# Maintainers

Each project runs itself with direction coming from maintainers, and support from maintainers and users. Being a maintainer is a hard job no matter how the project is structured. If at any point you need a break, assistance, or want to step down. Opening an issue here would be a good first step. We're here for eachother.

# Joining a Project to the organization

Criteria for joining is currently subjective and up for debate. Anything "core" to the Johnny-Five platform is welcome. If your project is on the [Johnny-Five.io](http://johnny-five.io/) website, you probably belong here.

Github doesn't make this a streamlined processes. We've figured out how to make it easier but we do require three things in advance.

1. A list of users with write access to your repo.
1. A list of users with admin access to your repo.
2. About 15 minutes of your time

All links will be redircted by github, all issues, wiki and commit history will be transfered. Please contact one of this project's maintainers to start the processes.

# Code of Conduct 
This meta project - like all projects in this organization - adhere to the [Johnny-Five Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) You can find a list of current maintainers at the top of this file. 

# Contributors Guide

Any points of policy or processes to be added, updated or removed should be discussed in a [github issue on this repo](https://github.com/j5js/meta/issues/new). The [Johnny-Five Gitter](https://gitter.im/rwaldron/johnny-five) chat is currently the best place to talk about our community outside of github issues.
